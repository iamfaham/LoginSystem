### For anyone who wants to use this project

Some important tips for using this template in your project:

1) For sending emails, using your own email :-
    - Create a gmail ID (or use existing one).
    - Go to gmail settings > app passwords > create a new one and fill in the details accordingly.
    - After creating a app password, copy that password. 
    - Open LoginSystem directory, go to settings.py file and find EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD.
    - Replace it with your generated app password.
    - Also replace EMAIL_FROM and EMAIL_HOST_USER with your own email.
 
2) Connect your own front-end (if necessary).
